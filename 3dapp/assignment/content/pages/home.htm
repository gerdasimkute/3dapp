                            Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.
                            Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented
                            in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888 Pemberton sold
                            Coca-Cola's ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics
                            led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st
                            century.

                            The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The
                            most common of these is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet
                            Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special
                            versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Coca-Cola was called Coca-Cola Classic from July 1985
                            to 2009, to distinguish it from "New Coke". Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study
                            of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand. In 2013, Coke products were
                            sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company
                            beverage servings each day. Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the
                            largest United States corporations by total revenue.
